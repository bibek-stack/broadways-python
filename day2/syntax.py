# In dentation in python is veryimportant.
# An indentation / tab is equivalent to 4 spaces 
# We do not use curly braces in python to detemine
# a block of code. Instead, we use indentation.

# following is an example of C code
# if(a=2){
#    printf("Hello world")
#  }
# Here the block of it condition is determined using
# curly braces

# But in python block is determined by indentation
# example
a =2
if a == 2:
  print("Hello Word")
