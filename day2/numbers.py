# there are three type under numbers data-type.
# Integer
# Float
# complex number

a =12
b= -33
c =0b1010 # binary number
d=0o127 # octal number
e=0xAf12 #0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B
# these are the integers types

a= 12.0
b=2.12
c= -3.2
d = 2e-4
e= 3e-4
# these  are the example of float thpes

a= 1+2j
b=2-3j
c=4j
# these are the exampl of complex type
