# there may be different projects in your system with different requirement of packages
# your one project may require pandas version 2.1 whereas other project may require pandas version 2.4
# so to solve this problem we can use the concept of virtual environment


#virtual environment is a separate environment in your system where we can install packages 
#in isolate form each project


# important commands
1. python -m venv <name_of_the_environment>
 => create a new virtual environment
 2. venv/scripts/activite (for windows device in command prompt)
2 deactive
4. pip install (package name)
=> it install the package the environment
5. pip freeze
=> it shows all the package of the environment
